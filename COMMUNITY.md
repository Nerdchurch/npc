# Community and Membership

## Philosophy
We believe communities thrive when knowledge and compassion intersect. Our community is made up of members, contributors, and collaborators who share curiosity, empathy, and purpose.

## Membership Structure
- **General Members** participate in conversations, projects, and events.  
- **Contributors** take active roles in specific projects or initiatives.  
- **Coordinators** provide leadership and organization within ongoing work.

## Communication
We maintain inclusive and accessible communication channels. Every message, meeting, or document reflects our shared values: curiosity, inclusivity, and honesty.  

## Code of Conduct
1. Treat all members with respect and empathy.  
2. Recognize and credit shared work appropriately.  
3. Promote accessibility and inclusion in all activities.  
4. Maintain constructive and open dialogue.  

## Participation Phases
We use a phased model of engagement: joining, learning, contributing, leading. Each phase builds responsibility and understanding before the next, ensuring sustainable collaboration.
