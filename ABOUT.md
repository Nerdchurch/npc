# About Nerdchurch Partners Corporation (NPC)

Nerdchurch Partners Corporation (NPC) is a nonprofit organization filing for 501(c)(3) status. Founded on the belief that curiosity and compassion are the roots of community, NPC provides a framework for projects that nurture civic engagement, lifelong learning, and mutual support.

NPC was created to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. It began as a network of small, collaborative projects — gatherings of people who wanted to understand the world and improve it together. Over time, these efforts grew into a shared ecosystem where dialogue, education, and creativity intersect.

NPC’s initiatives are diverse in focus but unified in purpose. From community organizing and education to digital access and cultural dialogue, each project reflects NPC’s commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and critical thinking.

**Organizational Model**  
NPC functions as an umbrella organization that provides infrastructure, guidance, and administrative support to its core projects. Each project has its own leadership, goals, and community, but all share NPC’s foundational values and accountability standards.

**Our Approach**  
NPC uses a phase-based model of development. Each project advances through clear, task-oriented milestones — building stability before growth, and collaboration before expansion. This ensures that every initiative evolves with intention and sustainability.

**Vision**  
A world where learning and empathy guide progress, where communities are empowered by access to knowledge, and where creativity and inquiry are celebrated as public goods.
