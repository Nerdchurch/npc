This documentation builds upon the open-source framework used in the Shared Thread LLC repository:  
https://github.com/mxchestnut/sharedthreadllc  

We adapted that structure for Nerdchurch Partners Corporation (NPC) to fit our nonprofit framework and mission.

We also reference guidance and best practices from:  
- National Council of Nonprofits — https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/  
- Propel Nonprofits: Business Planning for Nonprofits — https://propelnonprofits.org/resources/transforming-nonprofit-business-models/  
- IRS Charitable Organizations Guidance — https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/  
- TechSoup and Candid — for infrastructure, transparency, and technology development.  
- WCAG 2.1 and Section 508 — accessibility documentation and inclusion standards.

All written materials and concepts are original to Nerdchurch Partners Corporation (NPC) and released for public transparency, collaboration, and community education.
