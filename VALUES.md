# Values and Guiding Principles

NPC is built on principles that prioritize community, knowledge, and equity. These values guide every project and partnership.

**Accessibility**  
Knowledge and participation should be open to everyone. NPC commits to building accessible systems, communications, and events that include people of all abilities, backgrounds, and perspectives.

**Integrity**  
Transparency and accountability are central to our work. NPC maintains honesty in its governance, partnerships, and use of resources.

**Curiosity**  
We believe curiosity is an act of care â€” a way to engage with others and the world more deeply. NPC fosters environments where questions are valued as much as answers.

**Community**  
People learn best in connection with others. NPC invests in relationships and collaboration, recognizing that collective effort is the foundation of meaningful change.

**Creativity**  
Innovation grows from imagination. NPC supports creative problem-solving and welcomes interdisciplinary approaches that merge art, science, and civic purpose.

**Inclusivity**  
NPC celebrates diversity of experience, thought, and identity. We aim to build communities that reflect the complexity of the world and act with empathy toward those within it.
