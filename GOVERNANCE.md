# Governance Framework

## Overview
We structure our governance to balance accountability and collaboration. Our work depends on transparent decision-making, distributed leadership, and shared responsibility.

## Board of Directors
- **President:** Guides overall mission and strategic development.  
- **Vice President:** Supports leadership continuity and oversees internal coordination.  
- **Secretary:** Maintains records, policies, and compliance documentation.  
- **Treasurer:** Oversees financial stewardship, budgeting, and reporting.  

## Committees and Working Groups
Each of our projects may form short-term committees or coordinators to complete specific tasks within their current phase. We encourage collaborative leadership that reflects the diversity of our community.

## Decision-Making
We use a consensus-based model. Major decisions are discussed openly, refined through community input, and approved by majority vote from the Board or designated committees. Results are documented for public accountability.

## Reporting and Review
We publish periodic internal summaries and financial updates. Our governance reports track both project progress and organizational health to ensure transparency and adaptability.
