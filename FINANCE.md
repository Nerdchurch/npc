# Financial Framework

## Overview
We manage our finances with transparency, sustainability, and purpose. Every dollar we receive supports programs that promote accessibility, education, and community connection.

## Revenue Sources
- Donations and sponsorships.  
- Grants for educational, civic, and cultural initiatives.  
- Fundraising events and merchandise through Nerd Guild.  
- Collaborative partnerships and educational programs.

## Budget Philosophy
We allocate resources based on activity and measurable community impact. Each project receives funding proportional to its progress, participation, and needs. We maintain flexible reserves for unexpected challenges or opportunities.

## Oversight and Accountability
Our Treasurer manages records and reporting, with oversight from our Board of Directors. All major expenditures are reviewed collaboratively.  

## Transparency
We publish summaries of income, expenditures, and program highlights annually once our 501(c)(3) status is finalized. Financial clarity is an ethical commitment, not a procedural requirement.
